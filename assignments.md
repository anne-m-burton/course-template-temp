**Overview**

This page contains information about the various assignments for the course

**Data Portfolio**

This course does not require statistics or econometrics as a prerequisite, but that doesn't mean you can't learn (or practice) how to conduct descriptive analyses of large datasets!

**Group Presentation**

You will each give a 30-minute group presentation on a major episode or issue in U.S. crime policy. 

**Attendance and Participation**

Attendance and participation are important components of your grade. There are no exams in this course so think of class participation as a way to demonstrate your understanding of the course material.
